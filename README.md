# MakeCH4nge

The project answers to the need to find an optimal energy-mix solution for cooking 
transition interventions in developing countries.

In fact, when designing a project in the field of international cooperation, economic 
resources are limited by the available budget, and the project writer tends to rely on 
local suppliers who obviously try to channel the available cash flow to their own 
technology.

MakeCH4nge given the boundary conditions of maximum outlay, a limit related to 
the maximum allowable environmental emissions, and a maximum number of 
hours/day to devote to the "cooking" task sets three minumum objectives:

  1) The total costs linked to the project cycle (from purchase at year 0 to annual 
     running costs).
  2) The environmental impact.
  3) The social impact.
  
Since the software is target to project managers and professionals working in the field 
of cooperation, it was assumed that they are not keen on the language of computer 
programming.

Therefore, the system was featured with an intuitive graphic interface that filters the 
input information to communicate it to the hidden python code that performs the 
optimization in the background.
